- 👋 Hi, I’m @yellowdog03
- 👀 I’m interested in game dev, 3D modelling, and Python!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning front-end webdev (but not willingly).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment. Just here to keep my code accessible for now.
- 📫 How to reach me: DM on Discord at NonbinaryCode
- 😄 Pronouns: They/Them
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have a dog, Cajun, and he's a Catahoula Leopard Dog! He's an old man (he's 12 years old) but also he is my puppy.
